                Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects women and 
                can cause debilitating pelvic and period pain, as well as infertility. 
                It also affects parts of the body beyond the pelvic area. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to that found in the endometrium—the lining of the uterus—grows outside the uterus.
            </p>
            <p>
                This misplaced tissue typically develops on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the tissue lining the pelvis, though in rare cases it can spread beyond the pelvic region.

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Words are powerful. They can comfort, inspire or unintentionally hurt. For women living with endometriosis, respectful and compassionate communication can 
                provide a sense of comfort and belonging. It is not about saying the perfect thing 
                but about showing that we care and are willing to understand their journey.

            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                Diagnosis often starts with a review of medical history, focusing on symptoms, risk factors, and difficulties with pregnancy. 
                Your doctor may ask about period-related issues like pain, cycle length, and whether pelvic pain worsens during menstruation. 
                A physical exam, including a pelvic exam, follows to check for signs of endometriosis, such as tenderness or lumps near the ovaries.
