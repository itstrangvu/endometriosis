            Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects women and can cause debilitating pelvic and period pain, as well as infertility. 
            It also affects parts of the body beyond the pelvic area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to that found in the endometrium—the lining of the uterus—grows outside the uterus.
          </p>
          <p>
            This misplaced tissue typically develops on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the tissue lining the pelvis, though in rare cases it can spread beyond the pelvic region.

              Words are powerful. They can comfort, inspire, or unintentionally hurt. For women living with endometriosis, respectful and compassionate communication can provide a sense of comfort and belonging. 
              It is not about saying the perfect thing but about showing that we care and are willing to understand their journey.

        <h2 class="grid-title">Diagnosis</h2>
        <div class="grid-text">
          <p>
            Diagnosis often starts with a review of medical history, focusing on symptoms, risk factors, and difficulties with pregnancy. Your doctor may ask about period-related issues like pain, cycle length, and whether pelvic pain worsens during menstruation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imaging tests like ultrasounds or MRIs may be ordered to examine pelvic tissues. Based on medical history, physical exam findings, and imaging, a clinical diagnosis might be made to start treatment promptly without surgery. Medications like hormonal contraceptives or pain relievers are often prescribed at this stage.
